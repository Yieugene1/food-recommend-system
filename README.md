Firstly, utilizing web scraping technology, we successfully gathered a diverse range of culinary data and showcased it on the homepage of our website. Users have the ability to register an account, browse through their preferred dishes, and click to add them to their favorites. Additionally, users can rate dishes and explore videos showcasing various cultural cuisines, delving deeper into the intricacies of distinctive culinary delights.

Our culinary website also features a search function that employs the K-means algorithm to recommend a diverse array of dishes. Furthermore, we've implemented collaborative filtering algorithms to provide personalized culinary recommendations by analyzing user preferences and behaviors. When users view a particular dish, the website offers recommendations for similar dishes at the bottom of the page. Users can also rate and comment on dishes, which significantly influences the recommendations for similar users.

To address the cold start problem inherent in recommendation systems, we allow users to complete their profiles during registration, facilitating more personalized initial recommendations.
